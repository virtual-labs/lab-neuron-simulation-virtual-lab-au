  "introduction": "This lab models a section of excitable neuronal membrane using the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This lab focuses on understanding basic principles of resting potentials and describe mathematical models for studying resting potential of neurons. Experiments deigned in this lab explores in-depth about modelling of action potentials, role of potassium and sodium ion channels in neurons and describe how these ion channels affect the spiking patterns and how the gating properties regulate channel behavior firing patterns of different neurons. Students can expand their laboratory skillset by understanding the behavior of a nerve cell under different physiological conditions by studying the varying firing patterns at specific time period. The laboratory course can be further utilized as a self-learning or reference material for life science students.",
